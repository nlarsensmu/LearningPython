This is not intended to be a prepartion for working in the industry of software engineering, rather a guide to what programers do at a high level"

Below are a few examples of how we can represent integers. An integer can represent a number from -2147483648 to 2147483647. At a later time we will discuss why this is and what happens when we exceed these limits.\n",

    "NOTE: to view a variable you can pass it to the print method like below. You can also pass a string in before the variable so we can tell what was printed"
